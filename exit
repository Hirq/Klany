Help on QuerySet in module django.db.models.query object:

class QQuueerryySSeett(__builtin__.object)
 |  Represents a lazy database lookup for a set of objects.

 |  ____bbooooll____(self)
 |  
 |  ____ddeeeeppccooppyy____(self, memo)
 |      Deep copy of a QuerySet doesn't populate the cache
 |  
 |  ____ggeettiitteemm____(self, k)
 |      Retrieves an item or slice from the set of results.
 |  
 |  ____ggeettssttaattee____(self)
 |      Allows the QuerySet to be pickled.
 |

 |  
 |  ____iitteerr____(self)
 |      The queryset iterator protocol uses three nested iterators in the
 |      default case:
 |          1. sql.compiler:execute_sql()
 |             - Returns 100 rows at time (constants.GET_ITERATOR_CHUNK_SIZE)
 |               using cursor.fetchmany(). This part is responsible for
 |               doing some column masking, and returning the rows in chunks.
 |          2. sql/compiler.results_iter()
 |             - Returns one row at time. At this point the rows are still just
 |               tuples. In some cases the return values are converted to
 |               Python values at this location.
 |          3. self.iterator()
 |             - Responsible for turning the rows into model objects.

 |  
 |  aaggggrreeggaattee(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Returns a dictionary containing the calculations (aggregation)
 |      over the current queryset
 |      
 |      If args is present the expression is passed as a kwarg using
 |      the Aggregate object's default alias.
 |  
 |  aallll(self)
 |      Returns a new QuerySet that is a copy of the current one. This allows a
 |      QuerySet to proxy for a model manager in some cases.
 |  
 |  aannnnoottaattee(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Return a query set in which the returned objects have been annotated
 |      with extra data or aggregations.
 |  
 |  bbuullkk__ccrreeaattee(self, objs, batch_size=None)
 |      Inserts each of the instances into the database. This does *not* call
 |      save() on each of the instances, does not send any pre/post save
 |      signals, and does not set the primary key attribute if it is an
 |      autoincrement field (except if features.can_return_ids_from_bulk_insert=True).
 |      Multi-table models are not supported.
 |  
 |  ccoommpplleexx__ffiilltteerr(self, filter_obj)
 |      Returns a new QuerySet instance with filter_obj added to the filters.
 |      
 |      filter_obj can be a Q object (or anything with an add_to_query()
 |      method) or a dictionary of keyword lookup arguments.
 |      
 |      This exists to support framework features such as 'limit_choices_to',
 |      and usually it will be more natural to use other methods.
 |  
 |  ccoouunntt(self)
 |      Performs a SELECT COUNT() and returns the number of records as an
 |      integer.
 |      
 |      If the QuerySet is already fully cached this simply returns the length
 |      of the cached results set to avoid multiple SELECT COUNT(*) calls.
 |  
 |  ccrreeaattee(self, **kwargs)
 |      Creates a new object with the given kwargs, saving it to the database
 |      and returning the created object.
 |  
 |  ddaatteess(self, field_name, kind, order='ASC')
 |      Returns a list of date objects representing all available dates for
 |      the given field_name, scoped to 'kind'.
 |  
 |  ddaatteettiimmeess(self, field_name, kind, order='ASC', tzinfo=None)
 |      Returns a list of datetime objects representing all available
 |      datetimes for the given field_name, scoped to 'kind'.
 |  
 |  ddeeffeerr(self, *fields)
 |      Defers the loading of data for certain fields until they are accessed.
 |      The set of fields to defer is added to any existing set of deferred
 |      fields. The only exception to this is if None is passed in as the only
 |      parameter, in which case all deferrals are removed (None acts as a
 |      reset option).
 |  
 |  ddeelleettee(self)
 |      Deletes the records in the current QuerySet.
 |  
 |  ddiissttiinncctt(self, *field_names)
 |      Returns a new QuerySet instance that will select only distinct results.
 |  
 |  eeaarrlliieesstt(self, field_name=None)
 |  
 |  eexxcclluuddee(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Returns a new QuerySet instance with NOT (args) ANDed to the existing
 |      set.
 |  
 |  eexxiissttss(self)
 |  
 |  eexxttrraa(self, select=None, where=None, params=None, tables=None, order_by=None, select_params=None)
 |      Adds extra SQL fragments to the query.
 |  
 |  ffiilltteerr(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Returns a new QuerySet instance with the args ANDed to the existing
 |      set.
 |  
 |  ffiirrsstt(self)
 |      Returns the first object of a query, returns None if no match is found.
 |  
 |  ggeett(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Performs the query and returns a single object matching the given
 |      keyword arguments.
 |  
 |  ggeett__oorr__ccrreeaattee(self, defaults=None, **kwargs)
 |      Looks up an object with the given kwargs, creating one if necessary.
 |      Returns a tuple of (object, created), where created is a boolean
 |      specifying whether an object was created.
 |  
 |  iinn__bbuullkk(self, id_list=None)
 |      Returns a dictionary mapping each of the given IDs to the object with
 |      that ID. If `id_list` isn't provided, the entire QuerySet is evaluated.
 |  
 |  iiss__ccoommppaattiibbllee__qquueerryy__oobbjjeecctt__ttyyppee(self, opts, field)
 |      Check that using this queryset as the rhs value for a lookup is
 |      allowed. The opts are the options of the relation's target we are
 |      querying against. For example in .filter(author__in=Author.objects.all())
 |      the opts would be Author's (from the author field) and self.model would
 |      be Author.objects.all() queryset's .model (Author also). The field is
 |      the related field on the lhs side.
 |  
 |  iitteerraattoorr(self)
 |      An iterator over the results from applying this QuerySet to the
 |      database.
 |  
 |  llaasstt(self)
 |      Returns the last object of a query, returns None if no match is found.
 |  
 |  llaatteesstt(self, field_name=None)
 |  
 |  nnoonnee(self)
 |      Returns an empty QuerySet.
 |  
 |  oonnllyy(self, *fields)
 |      Essentially, the opposite of defer. Only the fields passed into this
 |      method and that are not already specified as deferred are loaded
 |      immediately when the queryset is evaluated.
 |  
 |  oorrddeerr__bbyy(self, *field_names)
 |      Returns a new QuerySet instance with the ordering changed.
 |  
 |  pprreeffeettcchh__rreellaatteedd(self, *lookups)
 |      Returns a new QuerySet instance that will prefetch the specified
 |      Many-To-One and Many-To-Many related objects when the QuerySet is
 |      evaluated.
 |      
 |      When prefetch_related() is called more than once, the list of lookups to
 |      prefetch is appended to. If prefetch_related(None) is called, the list
 |      is cleared.
 |  
 |  rraaww(self, raw_query, params=None, translations=None, using=None)
 |  
 |  rreevveerrssee(self)
 |      Reverses the ordering of the QuerySet.
 |  
 |  sseelleecctt__ffoorr__uuppddaattee(self, nowait=False)
 |      Returns a new QuerySet instance that will select objects with a
 |      FOR UPDATE lock.
 |  
 |  sseelleecctt__rreellaatteedd(self, *fields)
 |      Returns a new QuerySet instance that will select related objects.
 |      
 |      If fields are specified, they must be ForeignKey fields and only those
 |      related objects are included in the selection.
 |      
 |      If select_related(None) is called, the list is cleared.
 |  
 |  uuppddaattee(self, **kwargs)
 |      Updates all elements in the current QuerySet, setting all the given
 |      fields to the appropriate values.
 |  
 |  uuppddaattee__oorr__ccrreeaattee(self, defaults=None, **kwargs)
 |      Looks up an object with the given kwargs, updating one with defaults
 |      if it exists, otherwise creates a new one.
 |      Returns a tuple (object, created), where created is a boolean
 |      specifying whether an object was created.
 |  
 |  uussiinngg(self, alias)
 |      Selects which database this QuerySet should execute its query against.
